### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because using functions to code a
    Blackjack game fixed issures I notied in a Blackjack game from a
    previous lab. In the previous lab, the logic to calculate the bonus
    from Ace cards was incorrect. Although it passed the tests, it was
    satisfying to code better logic in this lab.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because the result was a program that has
    more utility compared to previous labs. Previous programs were isolated,
    but this spell checking program can actually be used on other text
    files. Of course the program isn't perfect, but its one of my first to
    interact with an already existing file. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 was a favorite because it was my introduction to random
    number generators and a graphics library. This lab was also one of the
    most challenging. Producing noisy gifs with text was also just fun.
